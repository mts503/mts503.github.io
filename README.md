### Modelling de Vries behaviour in liquid crystals
_Contributors: Kristian Poll_

Ferroelectric SmC* liquid crystals have the potential to be used widely in future display technologies, but the shrinkage they typically exhibit on tilting at the SmA/SmC transition is particularly problematic. A sub-class of these materials exhibit "de Vries" behaviour, in which no such shrinkage is observed, but the behaviour is poorly understood. We have used fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to gain an understanding of these intriguing materials.

### Elucidating structure-property relationships in dye-dope liquid crystals


## Methods
### Ab-initio methods
Ab-initio calculations involve first-principles (or pseudo-first-principles) methods to calculate properties, typically of static molecules/systems. They can be used to predict molecular properties such structural energies, spectral observables (UV-vis, IR, Raman, NMR etc.). The methods are also well suited to calculating reaction pathways enabling, for example, the prediction or rationalisation of reaction products.

### Classical methods
Classical methods use quite drastic (but undoubtedly successful) assumptions to enable the simulation of "large" systems, i.e. systems comprising <i>ca</i>. 1000 atoms or more. Their relatie simplicity enables  systems to be simulated over time. This combination provides a means of calculating bulk properties (density, etc.) as well as calculating time-dependent properties (diffusion, etc.). Furthermore, external potentials may readily be applied to simulate properties such as tensile strength and to simulate rare events.
