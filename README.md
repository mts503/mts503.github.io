### Ab-initio methods
Ab-initio calculations involve first-principles (or pseudo-first-principles) methods to calculate properties, typically of static molecules/systems. They can be used to predict molecular properties such structural energies, spectral observables (UV-vis, IR, Raman, NMR etc.). The methods are also well suited to calculating reaction pathways enabling, for example, the prediction or rationalisation of reaction products.

### Classical methods
Classical methods use quite drastic (but undoubtedly successful) assumptions to enable the simulation of "large" systems, i.e. systems comprising <i>ca</i>. 1000 atoms or more. Their relatie simplicity enables  systems to be simulated over time. This combination provides a means of calculating bulk properties (density, etc.) as well as calculating time-dependent properties (diffusion, etc.). Furthermore, external potentials may readily be applied to simulate properties such as tensile strength and to simulate rare events.
